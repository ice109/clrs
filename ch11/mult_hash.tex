\begin{document}
What is $kA\mod1$ supposed to produce? The fractional part of $kA$.
What does $ks$ produce? Well
\[
ks=kA\cdot2^{w}
\]
So it produces something that we have to divide by $2^{w}$ to get
what we want. But $k$ is $w$ or fewer bits and so 
\[
ks=kA\cdot2^{w}=r_{1}2^{w}+r_{0}
\]
I.e. $kA\cdot2^{w}$ can at most be $2\cdot w$ bits. Now dividing
by $2^{w}$ means just dropping $r_{1}$ (think of right shifting
$w$ times). so $r_{0}=kA\mod1$. Now how about multiplying by $m$
and taking floor? Well $m=2^{p}$ and it just amounts to left shifting
$r_{0}$ $p$ places or just taking the $p$ most significant bits.
